# Robot Grid Simulator
A comprehensive Python-based robot simulation system with both command-line and web interfaces. This project serves as a foundational exercise for AI and ROS2 integration training, featuring advanced robot control logic, path planning, and modern web interface design.

## Project Purpose

This simulator provides hands-on experience in several core areas of robotics and software development:

- **Robot Control Systems:** Implementing movement logic, pathfinding, and basic navigation strategies.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Applying clean Python architecture and design principles.
- **Web Development:** Integrating a Flask backend with an interactive HTML/JavaScript frontend.
- **Full-Stack Integration:** Connecting Python logic with a responsive web-based interface.
- **ROS2 Preparation:** Introducing foundational concepts used in modern Robot Operating Systems (ROS2).

##  Quick Start

###  Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Web browser** (for viewing the web interface)
- **(Optional)**: `Flask` and `Flask-CORS`  
  *Only required if you're running the web version*

To install Flask and Flask-CORS:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
