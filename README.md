# Robot Grid Simulator
A comprehensive Python-based robot simulation system with both command-line and web interfaces. This project serves as a foundational exercise for AI and ROS2 integration training, featuring advanced robot control logic, path planning, and modern web interface design.

## Project Purpose

This simulator provides hands-on experience in several core areas of robotics and software development:

- ** Robot Control Systems:** Implementing movement logic, pathfinding, and basic navigation strategies.
- ** Object-Oriented Programming:** Applying clean Python architecture and design principles.
- ** Web Development:** Integrating a Flask backend with an interactive HTML/JavaScript frontend.
- ** Full-Stack Integration:** Connecting Python logic with a responsive web-based interface.
- ** ROS2 Preparation:** Introducing foundational concepts used in modern Robot Operating Systems (ROS2).
