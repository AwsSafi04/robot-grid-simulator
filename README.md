# Robot Grid Simulator
A comprehensive Python-based robot simulation system with both command-line and web interfaces. This project serves as a foundational exercise for AI and ROS2 integration training, featuring advanced robot control logic, path planning, and modern web interface design.

# Project Purpose
This simulator provides hands-on experience with:

.Robot Control Systems: Movement logic, pathfinding, and navigation
.Object-Oriented Programming: Clean Python architecture and design patterns
.Web Development: Flask backend with interactive HTML/JavaScript frontend
.Full-Stack Integration: Connecting Python backend to web interface
.ROS2 Preparation: Foundation concepts for robot operating systems
